Interactive visualization tools for Julia

### Yet another plotting package?

Julia already has a rich set of plotting tools in the form of the [Plots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) and [Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) ecosystems, and various backends for these. So why another plotting package?

_InteractiveViz_ is **not** a replacement for _Plots_ or _Makie_, but rather a graphics pipeline system developed on top of Makie. It has a few objectives:

- To provide a simple API to visualize large or possibly infinite datasets (tens of millions of data points) easily.
- To enable interactivity, and be responsive even with large amounts of data.
- To render perceptually accurate summaries at large scale, allowing drill down to individual data points.
- To allow generation of data points on demand through a graphics pipeline, requiring computation only at a level of detail appropriate for display at the viewing resolution. Additional data points can be generated on demand when zooming or panning.

This package was partly inspired by the excellent [Datashader](https://datashader.org) package available in the Python ecosystem.

This package does not aim to provide comprehensive production quality plotting. It is aimed at interactive exploration of large datasets.

### Installation

Install InteractiveViz.jl with one of the Makie backends that support interactivity (GLMakie or WebGLMakie).

```julia
julia>]
pkg> add InteractiveViz GLMakie
```

If more than one Makie backend is available, switch between them in the usual way.

```julia
using GLMakie

GLMakie.activate!()

using WGLMakie
WGLMakie.activate!()
```

### Quick start

**NOTE: `InteractiveViz` API and internals changed in `v0.4`. If you're familiar with the older API, do read through the documentation again. The functionality has not changed much, but the `v0.4` uses the new Makie layout functionality and has improved its internal design to provide a more flexible data source API.**

Let's start off visualizing a simple function of one variable:
```julia
julia> using InteractiveViz, GLMakie
julia> ilines(sin, 0, 100)
```

This displays the `sin()` function with the initial view set to the _x_-range of 0 to 100. You can however, pan and zoom (as you would do with a normal `GLMakie` window) beyond this range.

Let's next try plotting 2 timeseries, each with 10 million points:
```julia
julia> ilines(5*sin.(0.02Ï€ .* (1:10000000)))
julia> ilines!(randn(10000000))
```

You can zoom and pan to see details:

Next, let us visualize the famous Mandelbrot set:
```julia
julia> using InteractiveViz.Demo
julia> iheatmap(mandelbrot, -2, 0.66, -1, 1)
```

Try zooming in to a tiny part of the image, and see the fractal nature of the image render itself dynamically at full resolution!

And how can we forget the Julia set?
```julia
julia> iheatmap(julia, -2, 2, -1.75, 1.75; colormap=:magma)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org-arl/InteractiveViz.jl/master/docs/images/plot-5.png)

You could of course plot a large heatmap stored in a matrix as well:
```julia
julia> iheatmap(range(0, 10; length=1000), range(0, 1; length=10000), randn(1000,10000))
```

Finally, let's try a scatter plot with ten million points:
```julia
julia> iscatter(randn(10_000_000), randn(10_000_000); markersize=3)
```
and add on another hundred thousand ones:
```julia
julia> iscatter!(randn(1_000_000) .- 1, randn(1_000_000) .- 1; color=:black, markersize=4)
```

Try zooming into this plot and see that it remains responsive as you zoom down to each individual point, or zoom out to get a birds-eye view!

While we haven't documented all the keyword options here, you'll find that all of the plot attributes for Makie work as options in _InteractiveViz_.

All of Makie's layout API also works as expected:
```julia
julia> using GLMakie
julia> f = Figure()
julia> p1 = iheatmap(f[1,1], julia, -2, 2, -1.75, 1.75; colormap=:magma)
julia> p2 = iheatmap(f[2,1], mandelbrot, -2, 0.66, -1, 1)
julia> Colorbar(f[1,2], p1.plot)
julia> Colorbar(f[2,2], p2.plot)
julia> p3 = ilines(f[1,3], sin, 0, 100; axis=(; limits=(0, 100, -1.5, 1.5)))
julia> p4 = ilines(f[2,3], range(0, 100; length=10000), randn(10000))
julia> linkxaxes!(p3.axis, p4.axis)
```

### Data sources

All `InteractiveViz` data sources are subtypes of the abstract `DataSource` type. Currently, three abstract subtypes of data sources are defined:
- `Continuous1D` for continuous one-dimensional data (e.g. time series),
- `Continuous2D` for continuous two-dimensional data (e.g. 2D topography heatmaps), and
- `PointSet` for discrete points (e.g. scatter plots).

The API to implement for each data source simply consists of two methods:
```
sample(data::DataSource, xrange::StepRangeLen, yrange::StepRangeLen)
limits(data::DataSource)
```

`sample()` samples the data source at a finite resolution and within a viewport represented by a `xrange` and `yrange`, and returns samples at the display resolution. The return type depends on the type of data source. Sampling a `PointSet` results in a `Point2fSet` of sample points. Sampling a `Continuous1D` results in a `Samples1D` of samples at the locations specified by `xrange`, or denser. Sampling a `Continuous2D` results in a `Samples2D` of samples at the locations specified by `xrange` and `yrange`.

`limits()` returns a tuple `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)` of default x and y axis limits for the data. If a limit is not applicable or unknown for the data source, `nothing` may be returned for that entry.

The default implementations available include:
- `Point2fSet`: vector of discrete 2D data points.
- `Samples1D`: uniformly sampled 1D data in a vector, automatically interpolated or aggregated, as required.
- `Samples2D`: uniformly sampled 2D data in a vector, automatically interpolated or aggregated, as required.
- `Function1D`: 1D function that generated the data dynamically on demand.
- `Function2D`: 2D function that generated the data dynamically on demand.

New types of data sources may be defined by the user. To use these, the underlying `iviz()` function has to be directly called on the data source. The `ilines()`, `iheatmap()` and `iscatter()` functions are simply convenience wrappers on the `iviz()` function.
